# T7_play_store_ratings
The project analyzes the various factors that affect the rating of an app from the google play store.
Dataset used:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauthamp10/google-playstore-apps

## How to run the code:
1. Install opendatasets library using `pip install opendatasets`. You can use conda as well.
2. Run the 2nd cell [the one that has od.download()] only once. It creates a directory in the current folder downloads the data there. The dataset hasn't been pushed into github due to large size (600 mb) and it would require a LFS which would complicate the working.
3. Comment out the above code once you've run it.
4. In case of VSCode, download the extension "Jupiter Notebook Renderers" for effective visualization of plotly codes.
5. Proceed normally.
