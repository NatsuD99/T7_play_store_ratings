# T7_play_store_ratings
The project analyzes the various factors that affect the rating of an app from the google play store.
Dataset used:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauthamp10/google-playstore-apps

## How to run the code:
1. Install opendatasets library using `pip install opendatasets`. You can use conda as well.
2. Run the 2nd cell [the one that has od.download()] only once. It creates a directory in the current folder downloads the data there. The dataset hasn't been pushed into github due to large size (600 mb) and it would require a LFS which would complicate the working.
3. Comment out the above code once you've run it.
4. Proceed normally.
