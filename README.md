# T7_play_store_ratings
The project analyzes the various factors that affect the rating of an app from the google play store.
Dataset used:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauthamp10/google-playstore-apps

## How to run the code:
1. Install opendatasets library using `pip install opendatasets`. You can use conda as well.
2. Run the 2nd cell [the one that has od.download_kaggle_dataset()] only once. It creates a directory in the C drive and downloads the data there. This is done because the size of the dataset is large and having it in this directory will have issue pushing it to github.
3. Comment out the above code once you've run it.
4. Proceed normally.
