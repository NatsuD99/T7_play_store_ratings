# XXX (Unknown Currency): This has a probability of approximately

# Both models have very low R-squared values, indicating that the 'Size' variable, as included in the models, explains only a tiny fraction of the variability in 'Minimum Installs' and 'Maximum Installs.'
# The statistical significance of the 'Size' coefficient suggests that there is a significant relationship between 'Size' and both 'Minimum Installs' and 'Maximum Installs.' However, the practical significance of these relationships is limited, given the low R-squared values.
# The high AIC and BIC values may indicate model complexity or issues that need further exploration.
# The diagnostic tests on residuals suggest that there might be violations of model assumptions, particularly regarding the normality of residuals.
# The large condition number in both models suggests potential multicollinearity issues, indicating that predictor variables may be correlated.
# In conclusion, while the models show statistical significance, the low R-squared values and potential issues with residuals and multicollinearity indicate that the current models may not provide a strong and reliable explanation for the variations in 'Minimum Installs' and 'Maximum Installs.' Further refinement, exploration, and consideration of additional variables may be necessary for a more robust analysis
