## Handling Missing values 
# So, we notice that there are no missing app IDs and none of the app IDs are duplicated as well.
# There are multiple apps with same names but the ID is different, so it fine.
# App Id, will thus be used as our primary key. 
# The 5 records in which the app name are missing, we'll remove those.

# There are 22883 apps that do not have a rating or a rating count. 
# Our ultimate target is to predict rating of an app. So imputing the missing values, no matter how good, isn't original. 
# With 2+ million data, we can affort to drop 22k records. So, let's do that.
